# Virtual-Fireworks
In this fun side project, I used a temperature sensor that when heated to a certain threshold, will trigger fireworks to go off in a processing sketch. The temperature is 70 celcius, so you need to hold a lighter under the temp, so in effect you are virtually "lighting" fireworks.
